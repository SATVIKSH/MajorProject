Nathvani, with him), for the appel lant. \\' M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (H. J. Umrigar, with him), for the respondent. 1950.\\nMay 26.\\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.\\nThis is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act.\\nThe assessee company is an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay.\\nFor the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head \"property\" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs. 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments.\\nThe company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax.\\nDeduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act.\\nOut of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs. 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants \\' burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disal lowed.\\nThe, appeals of the assessee to the Appellate As sistant Commissioner and to the Income tax Appellate Tribu nal were unsuccessful.\\nThe Tribunal, however, agreed to refer two questions of law to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, namely, (1) Whether the municipal taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under 555 the provisions of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act; (2) Whether the urban immoveable property taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under section 9 (1) (iv) or under section 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act.\\nA supplementary reference was made covering a third question which was not raised before us and it is not there fore necessary to refer to it.\\nThe High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal.\\nThe question for our determination is whether the munic ipal property tax and urban immoveable property tax can be deducted as an allowance under clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act.\\nThe decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act, and secondly, on a finding as to the true nature and character of the liability of the owner under the relevant Bombay Acts for the payment of these taxes.\\nSection 9 along with the relevant clause runs thus: (1) The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head \\' income from property \\' in respect of the bona fide annual value of property consisting of any buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of Which he is the owner, . . subject to the following allowances, namely : (iv) where the property is subject to a mortgage or other capital charge, the amount of any interest on such mortgage or charge; where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the. amount of such charge; where the property is subject to a ground rent, the amount of such ground rent; and, where the property has been acquired, constructed, repaired, renewed or recon structed with borrowed capital, the amount of any interest payable on such capital; . . . \" It will be seen that clause (iv) consists of four sub clauses corresponding to the four deductions allowed 556 under the clause.\\nBefore the amending Act of 1939, clause (iv) contained only the first, third and fourth sub clauses.\\nUnder the first sub clause interest is deductible whether the amount borrowed on the security of the property was spent on the property or not.\\nThere is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property.\\nThe expression \"capital charge\" in the sub clause cannot connote a charge on the capital, that is, the property assessed.\\nThat would be a redundancy as the opening words themselves clearly indicate that the charge is on the property.\\nWe are therefore of opinion that capital charge here could only mean a charge created for a capital sum, i.e., a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\\nIn 1933 the Privy Council decided the case of Bijoy Singh.\\nDudhuria vs Commissioner of Income tax, Calcutta (1 ).\\nIt was not an assessment under section 9 but an assess ment on the general income of an assessee who was liable to pay maintenance for his step mother which had been charged on all his assets by a decree of Court.\\nIt was not a li ability voluntarily incurred by him but one cast on him by law.\\nThe Privy Council held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment.\\nThough the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee \\'s income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee \\'s income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, \"where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge\" was added.\\nIt is this sub clause which the appellant invokes in support of its claim to deduction of the municipal and urban, property taxes in the present case.\\nIn view of the opening words of the newly added sub clause, the expression \"capital charge\" also used therein cannot have reference to a charge on the property, and we think it must (1) I.L.R. 60 cal.\\n557 be understood in the same sense as in sub clause (1); that is to say, the first sub clause having provided for deduc tion of interest where a capital sum is charged on the property, this sub clause provides for a deduction of annual sums so charged, such sums not being capital sums, the limiting words being intended to exclude cases where capital raised on the security of the property is made repayable in instalments.\\nIn Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji (1), a Bench of the Bombay High Court considered the meaning of these words.\\nAs regards \"annual charge,\" Beau mont C.J. observed as follows : \"The words, I think, would cover a charge to secure an annual liability.\" Kania J., as he then was, said as follows : \"I do not see how a charge can be annual unless it means a charge in respect of a payment to be made annually.\" This construction of the words has been followed in the judgment under appeal.\\nIn Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Income tax (2) (the connected appeal before us), the Bench of the Allahabad High Court agreed with the construction placed on these words in the Bombay case, i.e., the words \"annual charge\" mean a charge to secure an annual liability.\\nIt is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase \"annual charge\" occur ring in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words.\\nAs to the phrase \"capital charge\", Beaumont C.J. in the case above referred to took the view that the words mean a charge on capital.\\nKania J., however, took a different view and observed that he was not prepared to accept the sugges tion that a document which provides for a certain payment to be made monthly or annually and charged on immoveable property or the estate of an individual becomes a capital charge.\\nIn the Allahabad judgment under appeal these (1) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. 1944 All.\\n558 words were considered as not meaning a charge on capital.\\nIt was said that if an annual charge means a charge to secure the discharge of an annual liability, then, capital charge means a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.\\nWe think this construction is a natu ral construction of the section and is right.\\nThe determination of the point whether the taxes in dispute fall within the ambit of the phrase \"annual charge not being a capital charge\" depends on the provisions of the statutes under which they are levied.\\nSection 143 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, authorises the levy of a general tax on all buildings and lands in the city.\\nThe primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act).\\nIn order to assess the tax provision has been made for the determination of the annual rateable value of the building in section 154.\\nSection 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed.\\nSection 167 lays down that the assess ment book need not be prepared every official year but public notices shall be given in accordance with sections 160 to 162 every year and the provisions o+ the said sec tions and of sections 163 and 167 shall be applicable each year.\\nThese sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book.\\nFrom these provisions it is clear \\' that the liabil ity for the tax is determined at the beginning of each official year and the tax is an annual one.\\nIt recurs from year to year.\\nSections 143to 168 concern themselves with the imposition, liability and assessment of the tax for the year.\\nThe amount of the tax for the year and the liability for its payment having been determined, the Act then pre scribes for its collection in the chapter \"The collection of taxes.\\n\" Section 197 provides that each of the property taxes shall be payable in 559 advance in half yearly instalments on each first day of April and each first day of October.\\nThe provision as to half yearly instalment necessarily connotes an annual li ability.\\nIn other words, it means that the annual liability can be discharged by half yearly payments.\\nProcedure has also been prescribed for recovery of the instalments by presentment of a bill, a notice of demand and then distress, and sale.\\nFinally section 212 provides as follows : \"Property taxes due under this Act in respect of any building or land shall, subject to the prior payment of the land revenue, if any, due to the provincial ,Government thereupon, be a first charge . . upon the said build ing or land . \" It creates a statutory charge on the building.\\nUrban immove able property tax is leviable under section 22 of Part VI of the Bombay Finance Act, 1932,on the annual letting value of the property.\\nThe duty to collect the tax is laid on the municipality and it does so in the same manner as in the case of the municipal property tax.\\nSection 24 (2) (b) is in terms similar to section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act.\\nIt makes the land or the building security for the payment of this tax also.\\nFor the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act both these taxes, namely, the munici pal property tax as well as the urban immoveable property tax are of the same character and stand on the same foot ing.\\nMr. Munshi, the learned counsel for the appellant con tended that both the taxes are assessed on the annual value of the land or the building and are annual taxes, although it may be that they are collected at intervals of six months for the sake of convenience, that the income tax itself is assessed on an annual basis, that in allowing deductions all payments made or all liabilities incurred during the previ ous year of assessment should be allowed and that the taxes in question fell clearly within the language of section 9 (1) (iv).\\nThe learned Attorney General, on the other hand, argued that although the taxes are assessed for the year the liability to pay them arises at the beginning 560 of each half year and unless a notice of demand is issued and a bill presented there is no liability to pay them and that till then no charge under section 212 of the Act could possibly arise and that the liability to pay being half yearly in advance, the charge is not an annual charge.\\nIt was also suggested that the taxes were a capital charge in the sense of the property being security for the payment.\\nWe are satisfied that the contentions raised by the learned Attorney General are not sound.\\nIt is apparent from the whole tenor of the two Bombay Acts that the taxes are in the nature of an annual levy on the property \\' and are assessed on the annual value of the property each year.\\nThe annual liability can be discharged by half yearly instalments.\\nThe liability being an annual one and the property having been subjected to it, the provisions of clause (iv) of sub sec tion (1) of section 9 are immediately attracted.\\nGreat emphasis was laid on the word\"due\" used in section 212 of the Municipal Act and it was said that as the taxes do not become due under the Act unless the time for the payment arrives, no charge comes into existence till then and that the charge is not an annual charge.\\nWe do not think that this is a correct construction of section 212.\\nThe words \"property taxes due under this Act\" mean property taxes for which a person is liable under the Act.\\nTaxes payable during the year have been made a charge on the property.\\nThe liability and the charge both co exist and are co exten sive.\\nThe provisions of the Act affording facilities for the discharge of the liability do not in any way affect their true nature and character.\\nIf the annual liability is not discharged in the manner laid down by section 197, can it be said that the property cannot be sold for recovery of the whole amount due for the year ? The answer to this query can only be in the affirmative, i.e., that the proper ty is liable to sale.\\nIn Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji(1) Beaumont C.J., while rejecting the claim for the deduction of the taxes, placed reliance on (1) I.L.R. 561 section 9 (1) (v) which allows a deduction in respect of any sums paid on account of land revenue.\\nIt was observed that land revenue stands on the same footing as municipal taxes and that as the legislature made a special provision for deduction of sums payable in regard to land revenue but not in respect of sums paid on account of municipal taxes that circumstance indicated that the deduction was not allowable.\\nFor the same purpose reference was also made to the provi sions of section 10 which deal with business allowances and wherein deduction of any sum paid on account of land reve nue, local rates or municipal taxes has been allowed.\\nIn the concluding part of his judgment the learned Chief Jus tice said that it was not necessary for him to consider what the exact meaning of the words was and that it was suffi cient for him to say that it did not cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property under section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act.\\nWithout determining the exact meaning of the words used by the statute it seems to us it was not possible to arrive at the conclusion that the taxes were not within the ambit of the clause.\\nIt is elementary that the primary duty of a Court is to give effect to the intention of the legislature as expressed in the words used by it and no outside consideration can be called in aid tO find that intention.\\nAgain reference to clause (v) of the section is not very helpful because land revenue is a charge of a paramount nature on all buildings and lands and that being so, a deduction in respect of the amount was mentioned in express terms.\\nMunicipal taxes, on the other hand, do not stand on the same footing as land revenue.\\nThe law as to them varies from province to province and they may not be necessarily a charge on property in all cases.\\nThe legis lature seems to have thought that so far as municipal taxes on property are concerned, if they fall within the ambit of clause (iv), deduction will be claimable in respect of them but not otherwise.\\nThe deductions allowed in section 10 under the head \"Income from business\" proceed on a different footing and a construction of section 9 with the aid of section 10 is apt to mislead.\\n562 Kania J. in the above case in arriving at his conclusion was influenced by the consideration that these taxes were of a variable character, i.e., liable to be increased or re duced under the various provisions of the Municipal Act and that the charge was in the nature of a contingent charge.\\nWith great respect, it may be pointed out that all charges in a way may be or are of a variable and contingent na ture.\\nIf no default is made, no charge is ever enforceable and whenever there is a charge, it can be increased or reduced during the year either by payment or by additional borrowing.\\nIn Moss Empires Ltd. vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (1) it was held by the House of Lords that the fact that certain payments were contingent and variable in amount did not affect their character of being annual payments and that the word, \"annual\" must be taken to have the quality of being recurrent or being capable of recurrence.\\nIn Cunard \\'s Trustees vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (2) it was held that the payments were capable of being recur rent and were therefore annual payments within the meaning of schedule D, case III, rule 1 (1), even though they were not necessarily recurrent year by year and the fact that they varied in amount was immaterial.\\nThe learned Attorney General in view of these decisions did not support the view expressed by Kania J. Reliance was placed on a decision of the High Court of Madras in Mamad Keyi vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras(3), in which moneys paid as urban immoveable property tax under the Bombay Finance Act were disallowed as inadmis sible under section 9 (1) (iv) or 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act. \\'This decision merely followed the view expressed in Commissioner of income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedb hoy Rowji (4)and was not arrived at on any independent or fresh reasoning and is not of much assistance in the deci sion of the case.\\nThe Allahabad High Court (1) (2) [1948] 1 A.E.R. 150. (3) I.L.R. (4) I.L.R. 563 in Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Incometax (1) (the connected appeal) took a correct view of this matter and the reasoning given therein has our approval.\\nThe result is that this appeal is allowed and the two questions which were referred to the High Court by the Income tax Tribunal and cited above are answered in the affirmative.\\nThe appellants will have their costs in the appeal.\\nAppeal allowed.\\n',\n",
              " 'summary': 'The charge created in respect of municipal property tax by section 212 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, is an \"annual charge not being a capital charge\" within the mean ing of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act, 199.2, and the amount of such charge should therefore be deducted in computing the income from such property for the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act.\\nThe charge in respect of urban immoveable property tax created by the Bombay Finance Act, 1939 is similar in character and the amount of such charge should also be deducted.\\nThe expression \"capital charge\" in s.9(1) (iv) means a charge created for a capital sum,that is to say, a charge created to. \\' secure the discharge of a liability of a capi tal nature; and an \"annual charge\" means a charge to secure an annual liabili ty. 554\\n'}"

Patel to rigorous imprisonment for one year under each charge and to pay fines of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 2,000, and Rs. 1,000, under the first, second and third charges respectively.\\nThe appellant Nargundkar was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for six months under each charge and to pay fines of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 1.,000, under the first, second and third charges respectively.\\nEach of the appellants appealed against their respective convictions and sentences to the Court of the Sessions Judge, Nagpur.\\nThe learned Sessions Judge quashed the conviction of both the appellants under the first charge of criminal conspiracy under section 120 B, I.P.C., but maintained the 1093 convictions and sentences under section 465, I.P.C. or the charges of forging Exhibits P 3 (A) and P 24.\\nBoth the appellants went up in revision against this decision to the High Court but without any success.\\nAn application was then made under article 136 of the Constitution of India for special leave to appeal and this was allowed by this Court on 24th March, 1950 The appellant, Nargundkar, is a member of the Central Provinces &amp; Berar Provincial Service and held the substan tive post of Deputy Commissioner for several years.\\nIn April, 1946, he was appointed Excise Commissioner.\\nMadhya Pradesh, and continued to hold that office till the 5th September, '1947.\\nThe appellant, R.S. Patel, is a sugar Technologist and Chemical Engineer.\\nHe received his technical education and practical training in America and after working as Chief Chemist and General Manager in factories in Madras for five years, came to the Central Provinces in 1944, when the Provincial Government gave him a licence to set up a dis tillery for the manufacture of industrial spirit.\\nOn the 11th September, 1946, Nargundkar in his capacity as Excise Commissioner invited tenders for working the Government distillery at Seoni and supplying spirit to certain specified districts f or a period of four years from 1st April, 1947, to 31st March, 1951.\\nThe last date for submitting the tenders was the 31st October, 1946.\\nIn response to this tender notice, five tenders were filed including those filed by (1) appellant, R.S. Patel, (2) K.B. Habibur Rahman, (3).\\nZakirur Rahman, and (4) Edulji V. Doongaji (P. W. 4), in sealed covers with the Excise Commis sioner on the 31st October, 1946, and he handed them over with the seals intact to the office superintende.\\nnt, S.W. Gadgil (P. w. 13), for safe custody.\\nGadgil took them to his room and kept them under lock and key in the office safe.\\nThe case for the prosecution is that on the 9th Novem ber, 1946, accused Nargundkar took these sealed tenders home, that the tenders were opened by him at his house, that the rates of the tender (Exhibit 1094 P 6) of E.J. Doongaji (P. W. 4) were divulged to accused 2 (R. section Patel), who was allowed to substitute another tender (Exhibit P 3A), containing rates lower than those of Doongaji, that thereafter these open tenders were brought to the office on the 11th November, 1946, and given to Amarnath (P.W. 20) who was the Assistant Commissioner of Excise, for submitting a report and that on the recommendation of Nar gundkar the tender of accused 2 (Patel) was accepted and the contract was given to him.\\nIn May, 1947, on receipt of an application (Exhibit P 1) from one Dilbagrai (P. W. 14), enquiries were started by the Anti Corruption Department.\\nBoth the accused became aware of the enquiry.\\nIn order to create evidence in their favour they brought into existence a letter (Exhibit P 24) and antedated it to 20th November, 1946.\\nThis document was forged with the intention of com mitting fraud and of causing injury to Amarnath (P. W. 20) and also to Doongaji (P.W. 4).\\nExhibit P 24 is alleged to have been typed on a typewriter (Article A) which was pur chased on the 30th December, 1946, by the National Industri al Alcohol Co., Nagpur, of which accused Patel was the managing director.\\nIt Was further alleged that the endorse ment made by accused 1 (Nargundkar) in the said letter \"No action seems necessary.\\nFile\", and marked to Superintendent \"S\" was not made on the 21st November, 1946, which date it bears.\\nThis letter was handed over by accused 1 to the Office Superintendent, S.W. Gadgil (P.W. 13) about the middle of August, 1947, and thereafter accused I wrote a letter (Exhibit P. 26), on the 2nd October, 1947, to Sri section Sanyal (P.W. 19) who was then the Excise Commissioner, requesting that this letter (Exhibit P 24) and a note sheet (Exhibit P 27) be kept in sale custody.\\nBoth the accused denied the commission of the offences of criminal conspiracy, forgery and abetment thereof.\\nNargundkar denied having attended office on the 9th Novem ber, 1946.\\nHe denied having taken the tenders home.\\nAc cording to him, the tenders were opened by him in the office on the 1095 11th November, 1946.\\nAccused 2 denied that the tender of Doongaji was shown to him by accused 1 between the 9th and 11th November, 1946.\\nHe stated that the tender (Exhibit P 3A) was the original tender submitted by him on the 31st October, 1946.\\nAs regards Exhibit P 24, it was denied that it was fabricated or antedated.\\nAccused 2 stated that it was not typed on article A.\\nHe also alleged that the allegations made in Exhibit P 24 were correct.\\nAccused Nargundkar stated that the endorsement was made by him on the 21st November, 1946.\\nThe first charge having failed, nothing need be said about it herein.\\nIn order to prove the second charge the prosecution had to establish that Gadgil, P.W. 13, handed over the sealed tenders on the 9th November, 1946, to accused Nargundkar, that the latter took them home, that between the 9th and the 11th November he met Patel at his house or elsewhere and that accused.\\nNargundkar showed or communicated the particu lars of the tender of Doongaji to accused Patel who substi tuted Exhibit P 3A for his original tender before the 11th November, 1946.\\nAdmittedly there is no direct evidence to prove any of these facts except the first one, and the nature of the case is such that recourse could only be had to circumstantial evidence to establish those facts.\\nThe fact that the sealed tenders were handed over by Gadgil to accused Nargundkar on the 9th November has been held proved solely on the uncorroborated testimony of Gadgil as against the denial of Nargundkar.\\nGadgil was himself a suspect in the case.\\nHe was kept by the police away from the office for about eight months during the investigation, he was asked to proceed on leave at the instance of the police and his leave was extended at their request.\\nOn the expiry of his leave he was kept off duty without salary for a period of about five months but later on he was paid his full salary after he had given evidence in support of the prosecution.\\nHe made addi tions and improvements on vital points from stage to stage of his deposition and in certain particulars his statement was contradicted by Ramaswami, P.W. 80.\\nOn his own admission he is an accomplice in respect 1096 of the forgery of Exhibit P 27, one of the documents al leged to have been forged for purposes of the defence but concerning which no prosecution was started.\\nExhibit P 27 bears date 31st October, 1946.\\nGadgil 's statement about it is as follows: \"He (Nargundkar) put down his signature and the date 31st October, 1946.\\nThis order was actually written by Sh.\\nNargundkar in the note sheet, Exhibit P 27, in the month of July or August, 1947.\\nThe dates were antedated.\\nIn the margin of the note sheet I have put down my initials S.W.G. and put the date 31st October, 1946.\\nThis note sheet was not prepared on gist October, 1946.\\nHe asked me to keep it in my custody.\\n\" The witness admittedly became a party to the preparation of a forged document.\\nWhether he was telling the truth, or he was telling a lie, as appears likely from his cross examination, he is in either event, not a person on whom any reliance could be placed.\\nIt is curious that this aspect of the evidence of Gadgil has not been noticed by any of the three courts below.\\nWhen the court of first instance and the court of appeal arrive at concurrent findings of fact after believing the evidence of a witness, this court as the final court does not disturb such findings, save in most exceptional cases.\\nBut where a finding of fact is arrived at on the testimony of a witness of the character of Gadgil and the courts below depart from the rule of prudence that such testimony should not be accepted unless it is corroborated by some other evidence on the record, a finding of that character in the circumstances of a particular case may well be reviewed even on special leave if the other circumstances in the ease require it, and substantial and grave injustice has result ed.\\nAfter fully examining the material on the record we have reached the conclusion that the courts below were in error in accepting the uncorroborated testimony of Gadgil to find the fact that he handed over the tenders to Nargund kar on the 9th November, 1946.\\nThe witness was not allowed to live in a free atmosphere and was kept under police 1097 surveillance during the whole of the period of investigation and the trial and was rewarded with payment of his full salary after he had given evidence to the satisfaction of the prosecution.\\nHe is a person who felt no hesitation in deposing on oath that he willingly became a party to the forgery of Exhibit 13 27.\\nAssuming that the accused Nargundkar had taken the tenders to his house, the prosecution, in order to bring the guilt home to the accused, has yet to prove the other facts referred to above.\\nNo direct ' evidence was adduced in proof of those facts.\\nReliance was placed by the prosecution and by the courts below on certain circumstances, and intrinsic evidence contained in the impugned document, Exhibit P 3A.\\nIn dealing with circumstantial evidence the rules specially applicable to such evidence must be borne in mind.\\nIn such cases there is always the danger that conjecture or suspi cion may take the place of legal proof and therefore it is right to recall the warning addressed by Baron Alderson to the jury in Reg vs Hodge (1) where he said : \"The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circum stances to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such matters, to over reach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that 'is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete.\\n\" It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so estab lished should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.\\nAgain, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.\\nIn (1) 141 1098 other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far com plete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.\\nIn spite of the force ful arguments addressed to us by the learned Advocate Gener al on behalf of the State we have not been able to discover any such evidence either intrinsic within Exhibit P 3A or ,outside and we are constrained to observe that the courts below have just fallen into the error against which warning was uttered by Baron Alderson in the above mentioned case.\\nThe trial magistrate was of the opinion that friendship between the two accused was of a very rapid growth and that their relations were very intimate and accused 2 was in a position to influence accused 1.\\nHe thus found that there was motive for the commission of the crime.\\nThe learned Sessions Judge disagreed with this finding and the High Court agreed with the Sessions Judge on this point.\\nIt observed that the evidence which tended to prove friendship or undue favour was not such as to form the basis for a finding.\\nIt further found that there was nothing to show that the appellant Nargundkar received any illegal reward or the promise of one for showing Doongaji 's tender to accused R.S. Patel.\\nThe first circumstance therefore on which the trial Judge placed considerable reliance was negatived by the court of appeal and in revision.\\nIt having been found that there was no motive whatsoever for accused Nargundkar to show the tenders to accused Patel and to take a substi tuted tender from him, the main link in the chain of reason ing of the trial court vanishes.\\nAmiable relations between the two accused or their official relationship could not be regarded as sufficient motive for committing the crime of forgery.\\nThe mainstay of the prosecution case is the intrinsic evidence of the contents of Exhibit P 3A itself which ac cording to the courts below are unusual, peculiar and strange and which according to the Advocate General could not be there if it was a genune 1099 document.\\nThe argument would have force provided the prem ises on which it is based are correct.\\nHaving examined the contents of Exhibit P 3A, we do not find anything very unusual or extraordinary in it which could not be there without its author having seen Exhibit P 6.\\nWe now proceed to examine the so called peculiar features in Exhibit P 3A.\\nIn order to appreciate the points made by the learned Advocate General it is necessary to set out certain facts.\\nExhibit P 9 is the notice calling for tenders for the supply of country spirit in the Seoni distillery area.\\nThe rates which were called for by this notice were as follows: 1.\\nFlat rate for four years.\\nRates on sliding scale for four years.\\nAll in rate on the sliding scale for one year 1947 48. 4.\\nFlat rates on the basis of the price of mahua flowers for three years 1948 51. 5.\\nAll in sliding scale rate on the basis of the price of mahua flowers for three years 1948 51.\\nThe trial magistrate held on a construction of it that no rate or rates of separate years were asked for in this notice and that one flat rate was only asked for, for four years.\\nHabibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman in their tenders, Exhibits P 4 and P 5, quoted one flat rate for four years and did not mention separate flat rates for separate years.\\nDoongaji in his tender, Exhibit P 6, mentioned separate flat rates for each separate year also.\\nHe did so because he consulted one Mr. Munshi, Personal Assistant to the Excise Commissioner, whether he should quote each rate separately and Mr. Munshi told him that he could give flat rate for the combined years as well as flat rates and also sliding scale rates for each year separately.\\nAdmittedly accused 2 was working as an agent of Habibur Rahman and his son Zakirur Rahman for the distillery contracts of Betul and Seoni, and, therefore, he must have been the author not only of his own tender but of the tenders submitted by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman, Exhibits 1100 P 4 and P 5.\\nAll of them were acting together with the object of getting the contract though they were submitting three separate tenders.\\nThe trial magistrate held that as Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman gave one flat rate for four years as called for by Exhibit P 9, but accused 2, the author of all these tenders, did not do it in Exhibit P 3A, but followed the method of Doongaji in giving the rates of each year separately as well as the rate for the combined four years.\\nlie must have done so as he was shown the tender Exhibit P section The question arises whether the circumstance that the accused Patel and Habibur Rahrnan and Zakirur Rahman were acting together was such from which a necessary inference arises that the accused Patel must have been the author of all the three tenders and, if he were, that he could not have departed from the method adopted by him in preparing Exhibits P 4 and P 5 unless and until he had seen Exhibit P 6.\\nWe are clearly of the opinion that from the premises stated this inference does not necessarily follow.\\nDoongaji even after reading Exhibit P 9, could not make up his mind whether to submit the tender with one flat rate for all the four years or whether to submit it by giving sepa rate flat rates for each of the four years and made enquiry from the office of the Excise Commissioner and then quoted separate rates for each of the four years separately also.\\nPatel who has admittedly considerable experience of distill ery contracts and about the method of submitting tenders might very well have thought that it was best to quote a flat rate for all the years as well as a flat rate for each year separately.\\nThe circumstance that he did not do so in the other two tenders prepared by him does not materially advance the prosecution case.\\nThe very object of submitting several tenders on behalf of three persons acting in unison was to indicate to the excise authorities that they were being submitted by three different persons.\\nIf there were no variations whatsoever between those tenders that would have defeated the very purpose of submitting them.\\nMore over, a variation of this trifling nature between Exhibits P 3A and P 4 1101 and P 5 cannot be said to be of such an unusual or of such an extraordinary character as to warrant the inference that it could not have been made except without a look at the tender of Doongaji.\\nThe circumstance is of a neutral charac ter and the trial magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge gave undue importance to it, being obsessed with the idea that such a quotation of flat rates for each year could not be mentioned in a tender by a contractor merely on a con struction of Exhibit P 9 and without any further inquiry or without seeing the tender of somebody else who had followed that method.\\nThe next circumstance on which considerable reliance is placed is that accused 2 studiously maintained rates below the rates of Doongaji throughout, that when Doongaji lowered his rates for the second year accused 2 did the same, and when Doongaji raised his rates for the third and fourth years accused 2 also did so, at the same time maintaining rates lower than Doongaji 's rates.\\nIt is said that the system followed by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman and Patel originally must have been the same as Patel was the author of all the three tenders, that Habibur Rahman 'srates were higher than Zakirur Rahman 's by six pies and this variation was constant throughout, that in Patel 's original tender which must have followed the same system his rates would be lower than Habibur Rahman 's by three pies through out.\\nExhibit P 3A, however, shows that this is not so.\\nPatel abandoned the system when he found that his rates on his original scheme would be higher than the correspond ing rates of Doongaji.\\nLearned Advocate General contended that it was impossible for Patel unless he had seen Exhibit P 6, to quote rates of a large number of items numbering about 197, in every case lower than the rates given in Exhibit P 6 and the circumstance that in not a single case he has quoted a higher rate than Exhibit P 6 is conclusive of the fact that he had done so after he had seen Exhibit P 6.\\nIt was also said that there is no satisfactory explana tion why Patel abandoned the scheme adopted by him in 1102 drawing up Exhibits P 4 and P 5 and his original tender.\\nIn our view, this circumstance again is not so strange or peculiar as was made out by the learned Advocate General or in the courts below.\\nIn the first place, there is no material whatsoever for the assumption that the so called original tender was drawn up on the same scheme as Exhibits P 4 and P 5 or that there was a constant variation in rates between it and Habibur Rahman 's tender.\\nIt has been assumed on mere surmise that the first five rates in the tender, Exhibit P 3A, are the rates that had been originally quoted.\\nThe original tender is not forthcoming and there is no evidence at all about its contents.\\nMoreover, in the depo sition of Doongaji it was elicited that in the year 1942 when tenders for the Seoni distillery contract were called for, the rates quoted by Ratanshah were lower than his rates for all items.\\nHe, however, voluntarily added that Ratanshah obtained his rates of the previous contracts before he submitted his tender for the year 1942 and that he had made a reduction of annas two to three in those rates but he was forced to admit that the rate of Ratanshah in the tender was not only lower than his but was also lower throughout than the rates of Laxminarain, Haji Ismail and Habibur Rahman even without seeing their tenders.\\nFrom this statement it is quite clear that even without seeing the tenders of differ ent tenderers a contractor may quote rock bottom rates of all items on his own calculation or impelled by the desire of taking the contract anyhow.\\nWe do not follow why Patel could not do in 1946 what was done by Ratanshah in his tenders in 1942 and quote rates lower in all particulars and regarding all items than the rates of Doongaji.\\nIf a person is out to give rockbottom rates and his calculation is such that his rates work out lower than the rates of others, it may well be that he may quote lower rates in respect of all items.\\nIt was then said that Patel had adopted a particular plan in submitting the three tenders, of himself, Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman and that his plan was that his rates should be less by three pies 1103 than the rates he had quoted for Habibur Rahman, that in the first five items of Exhibit 145 he stuck to that plan and did not alter the rates of those items as originally submit ted by him, as those rates were lower than the rates of Doongaji but from the sixth item onwards he substituted new rates for the ones he had originally submitted and he de parted from the plan so that his rates for each item were to be lower only by three pies as compared with the rates of Habibur Rahman.\\nIt is no doubt true that Patel did not adhere to the plan that he adopted in the first five items of his tender but is that a circumstance from which any inference can be drawn that the first five items are a part of his original tender or that he did so depart from them because he had seen Exhibit P 6 and he wanted to underbid Doongaji.\\nAs we have already said, the object of submitting three separate tenders ostensibly by persons who were acting together was to secure the contract in one or the other name and Patel who was the author of all the three documents may very well in his own document have quoted much lower figures than were quoted by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman, in order also to give the impression that all these tenders had not been submitted by one and the same person.\\nBe that as it may, a closer examination of the tenders of Doongaji and Patel completely negatives the theory of the courts below.\\nThe rates quoted in the first five items of Exhibit P 145 are lower than the rates of Doongaji by 102, 69, 18, 12 and 9 pies respectively.\\nEven in the subsequent quotations except in one case where the disparity in the tales of Doongaji and Patel is only two pies, the disparity in the rates is from 9 to 11 pies.\\nPatel is certainly a businessman and the whole object of quoting the rates was to earn the maximum profit.\\nIf he had seen the tender of Doongaji he would have modelled the rates in a manner that would give him the highest profit.\\nThe learned Advocate General could not suggest any reason whatsoever why Patel would maintain his quotation for the quantity of 50,000 gallons at Rs, 2 10 6 when the rate of Doongaji was Rs. 3 3 0 1104 He could easily raise the quotation to Rs. 3 and similarly in all other cases he could have underbid Doongaji by 2, 3 or 6 pies at the most.\\nHe need not have maintained a dis parity of 9 to 11 pies between his rates and the rates of Doongaji.\\nIn our opinion, therefore, no conclusion of any character could be drawn from the disparity in the rates of Doongaji or of Patel or of the expected uniformity in the rates of Habibur Rahman or of R.S. Patel which would estab lish that Exhibit P 3A had been prepared by having a look at Exhibit P 6.\\nAnother circumstance on which reliance was placed was that certain rates in Exhibit P 3A are lower than the corre sponding rates in Exhibit P 6 by only one or two pies.\\nThere is no doubt that one or two rates are lower by two pies than the rates in Exhibit P 6 but nothing follows from that innocent circumstance, unless one starts with a pre sumption of guilt.\\nOnce it is assumed that the tender of Doongaji was shown to Patel, all these circumstances might to some extent fit in with the view that in certain respects it may have been copied from Exhibit P 6.\\nThe courts below fell into this error and departed from the rule that in a criminal case an accused person is to be presumed to be innocent and that it is for the prosecution to establish his guilt conclusively.\\nNext it was urged that in the covering letter Exhibit P 3 sent by Patel he mentions three appendices numbered 1, 2 and 3, The same expression finds place in the covering letter Exhibit P 4 of Habibur Rahman and Exhibit P~5 of Zakirur Rahman, that appendices 1 to a of the tender of Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman correctly answer to the reference in the covering letters but this is not so in Patel 's case; on the other hand, instead of appendix 1, Patel has appendix 1 (a) and 1 (b) and the number of his appendices thus goes up to four and this departure from Exhibits P 4 and P 5 came about because of his having seen Exhibit P 6 and the number of appendices annexed to it.\\nIt was urged that the original tender of Patel must have contained three appendices like those of Habibur Rahman and 1105 Zakirur Rahman and not appendix l(a) and l(b) as now found and that this circumstance showed substitution of the 'tender.\\nThe learned magistrate, in our opinion, in giving importance to this circumstance mislead himself completely.\\nIn the first place, it is not accurate to say that the expression appendices 1, 2 and 3 was common to the covering letters Exhibts P 4 and P 5.\\nIn Exhibit P 5 the appen dices are marked A, B and C. Therefore, no uniform method was adopted by Patel in marking the appendices to the ten ders, Exhibits P 4 and P 5.\\nSecondly, there is no conflict in the expression of the appendices of Habibur Rahman and Patel.\\nThey have been marked as 1, 2 and 3 and a mere subdi vision of the first appendix into (a) and (b) could not be taken to be a departure from the method adopted in the description of the appendices.\\nIt may further be observed that the covering letter signed by Patel mentions four appendices, while the covering letters of Habibur and Zaki rur Rahman only mention three appendices.\\nThe trial magis trate as well as the Sessions Judge ignored all these dif ferences in the method of the description of the appendices and assumed that they had been uniformly described.\\nThe result therefore is that all these so called peculiar features found by the courts below in Exhibit P 3A should be eliminated from consideration and it must be held that there are really no circumstances inconsistent with Exhibit P 3A being a genuine document.\\nIt could have been made out without looking at Exhibit P 6.\\nIn this view of the case the whole basis on which the judgments of the courts below are founded vanishes, and in the absence of any evidence of motive, we are of the opinion that the facts did not on any just or legal view of them warrant a conviction, and al though the proceedings are taken to have been unobjection able in form, justice has gravely and injuriously miscar ried.\\nWe therefore set aside the conviction of both the appellants on the second charge and acquit them, 142 1106 In order to appreciate the third charge, it is necessary to set out the terms of Exhibit P 24 which it is said was antedated in order to create evidence for the defence of the accused and to injure Amarnath.\\nIt is in these terms: Congress Nagar, Nagpur, 20th November, 1946.\\nThe Commissioner of Excise, C.P. &amp; Berar, Nagpur.\\nDear Sir, I beg to submit few of my complaints for such action as you may be pleased to take, which are as under.\\nI went to see Mr. Amarnath last week, at his residence in connection with Seoni Distillery work.\\nI saw Mr. Edulji and his partner with Mr. Amarnath in the office room of his residence with some office files.\\nFrom the papers I could recognize my tender open on the table in front of them.\\nAs soon as I went there, all of them were astonished and they could not speak with me for a moment, and then they carried on some dry general conversation with me.\\nSame way after about a week, when I went to Seoni for mahua bill, when Mr. Amarnath visited for sanctioning the advance, I had the opportunity to see Mr. Amarnath in dak bungalow at about 9 30 p.m. when I saw Mr. Mehta the ex manager of Mr. Edulji (who is also the manager of Seoni Electric Co.) with Mr. Amarnath near table with the same file of the tender.\\nNo doubt after seeing the above two incidents I requested Mr. Amarnath to be fair in this af fair.\\nI am bringing these incidents to your notice, as I fear that something underhand may not be going on, and I am afraid that my tender may be tampered with.\\nHoping to get justice, Yours faithfully, Sd.\\nR.S. Patel.\\n\" 1107 The words \"Congress Nagar, Nagpur, 20th November, 1946\" are in manuscript, while the rest of the letter has been typed.\\nThe digit 6 of the year 1946 has been over written on digit 7 written in continental style and it is apparent to the naked eye that originally the writer wrote 7 and subsequently changed it to 6.\\nIt was contended by the learned Advocate General, and this is the finding of the courts below, that this letter was written some time during the investigation of the case in July or August 1947, and was antedated in order to implicate Amarnath and to use it as evidence in defence.\\nThe point for decision is wheth er there is any evidence whatsoever to establish this act.\\nWe have not been able to discover any such evidence on the record; on the other hand the intrinsic evidence in the letter proves that most likely it came into existence on the date it bears.\\nThe relevant facts are that the tenders were opened by accused Nargundkar on the 11th November, 1946, he handed them over after making the endorsements to Amarnath and Amarnath had to submit a report about them.\\nIt is alleged in this letter that \"last week\", i.e., during the week commencing on the 11th November, 1946, accused Patel went to see Amarnath and there he saw Edulji Doongaji with him with his tender open on his table in front of him and that he was astonished at it, that about a week later he again went to Seoni and had the opportunity to see Amarnath and Mr. Mehta, ex manager of Edulji Doongaji, was with him and the tender file was lying there.\\nIt was stated that he had requested Amarnath to be fair in this affair and the Commissioner was asked that he should see that his tender was not tampered with and he got justice.\\nThe whole purpose and object of this letter was to protect himself against any underhand dealing in the granting of the contract.\\nIn his statement under section 342, Cr. P.C., Patel said that he saw Amarnath on the morning of the 15th or 16th November, 1946, and he met Amarnath at Seoni at the distillery prem ises on the 16th November, 1946, and on the same 1108 day he met him at about 9 p.m. at the Seoni dak bungalow and that he again met him on the 17th November, at 10 a.m.\\nHe also stated that he had gone to see Amarnath at his resi dence at Nagpur between the dates 12th and 18th November.\\nIt was contended by the learned Advocate General that his statement was inconsistent with the recitals contained in Exhibit P 24.\\nWe see nothing inconsistent between this statement and the recitals.\\nIf accused Patel saw Amarnath on the 12th, the letter having been written on the 20th November, it would be quite a correct thing to say that he saw him \"last week\" and the next recital when he said that about a week thereafter he saw him again is quite consistent with his going and seeing him on the 16th or 17th November.\\nThat would be about a week after the first visit.\\nTo draw any conclusion adverse to the accused from a slight inaccu racy in the description of dates and to conclude therefrom that it was established that the accused Patel had seen Amarnath on the 9th November, 1946, amounts to unnecessari ly stretching a point against the accused.\\nThe recitals in the letter, true or false, are quite consistent with the letter bearing date 20th November, 1946.\\nThe magistrate observed that the vagueness about the date and the week shows that the allegations therein are not correct.\\nWe have not been able to understand how the vagueness about the date could lead to the conclusion arrived at.\\nEmphasis was laid on the overwriting of the figure 6 over the figure 7 in the manuscript part of the letter.\\nIt was said that the normal experience is that it becomes a subconscious habit to automatically write the year correctly when several months have elapsed after the change of the year and that by sheer force of habit the correct year must have been put down when the date was entered in the letter Exhibit P 24 and that the figure was subsequently changed to 6 and this fact was an indication that the letter was written some time in the year 1947.\\nIn our view this argument again involves an element 1109 of conjecture.\\nThe mistake may well have been inadvertent ly made and the correction made there and then.\\nThat such mistakes are not very uncommon or unusual and occur in official documents is fully established on the record, in para 93 of the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge and it is said as follows: \"The appellants have produced a file which is Exhibit ID 35.\\nIt contains a sheet which bears pages 9 and 10.\\nOn the 10th page there are two office notes one is written by A.M. Naidu and the other by the appellant Nargundkar.\\nA.M. Naidu below his signature has written '6 4 1948 '.\\nThe appellant Nargundkar below his signature has written '6 4 1947 '.\\nThe other notes in the office file show that the correct date of the two signatures was 6th August, 1947.\\nThus in this sheet there are two mistakes in mentioning the number of the month and one mistake in mentioning the number of the year.\\nThe appellants contend that such mistakes are possible.\\nNobody can deny that such mistakes are possible; but it has to be decided what inferences can be drawn from such mistakes, if there is other evidence also.\\n\" We have looked in vain for other evidence to prove that the letter was not written on 'the date it bears.\\nEven Gadgil could not explain why he said that the letter was written in July, 1946.\\nIt is clear that he is not telling the ' truth in this respect.\\nThe endorsement made on the letter by accused Nargundkar clearly bears the date 21st November, 1946, and if this letter was not given to him on the date of the endorsement and was given to him several months afterwards he would in ordinary course have made some note either on the letter or in the receipt register of his office when that letter was received by him.\\nThen it was said that this letter was not in the file of the tenders which were kept separate.\\nThe Commissioner had noted that the letter be filed and he sent it to the office.\\nIf the office people did not put it in the file, from that circum stance no adverse inference could 1110 be drawn as to the date that the letter bears.\\nIt is dear that no forger would have in such a clumsy manner corrected 1947 into 1946 so as to leave the original figure \"7\" intact and thus leave evidence of its suspicious character writ large on its face.\\nThere was no hurry about it, and a second letter without the alteration could easily have been typed.\\nNext it was argued that the letter was not typed on the office typewriter that was in those days, viz., article B, and that it had been typed on the typewriter article A which did not reach Nagpur till the end of 1946.\\nOn this point evidence of certain experts was led.\\nThe High Court rightly held that opinion of such experts was not admissible under the Indian Evidence Act as they did not fall within the ambit of section 45 of the Act.\\nThis view of the High Court was not contested before us.\\nIt is curious that the learned Judge in the High Court, though he held that the evidence of the experts was inadmissible, proceeded nevertheless to discuss it and placed some reliance on it.\\nThe trial magis trate and the learned Sessions Judge used this evidence to arrive at the finding that, as the letter was typed on article A which had not reached Nagpur till the end of December, 1946, obviously the letter was antedated.\\nTheir conclusion based on inadmissible evidence has therefore to be ignored.\\nIt was further held that the evidence of experts was corroborated by the statements of the accused recorded under section 342.\\nThe accused Patel, when questioned about this letter, made the following statement: \"Exhibit P 31 was typed on the office typewriter article B. Exhibit P 24 being my personal complaint letter was typed by my Personal Assistant on one of the typewriters which were brought in the same office for trial, with a view to purchase.\\nAs this was my personal complaint no copy of it was kept in the Correspondence Files Exhibit P 34 and Exhib it P 35 just 1111 as there is no copy in these files of my tender Exhibit P 3A . . .\\nIn the month of September, October and November, 194t5, several machines were brought for trial from various parties in our of rice till the typewrit er article A was purchased by National Industrial Alcohol Ltd. Company.\\n\" If the evidence of the experts is eliminated, there is no material for holding that Exhibit P 24 was typed on article A.\\nThe trial magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge used part of the statement of the accused for arriving at the conclusion that the letter not having been typed on article B must necessarily have been typed on article A.\\nSuch use of the statement of the accused was wholly unwar ranted.\\nIt is settled law that an admission made by a person whether amounting to a confession or not cannot be split up and part of it used against him.\\nAn admission must be used either as a whole or not at all.\\nIf the statement of the accused is used as a whole, it completely demolishes the prosecution case and, if it is not used at all, then there remains no material on the record from which any inference could be drawn that the letter was not writeen on the date it bears.\\nFor the reasons given above we hold that there is no evidence whatsoever on the record to prove that this letter Exhibit P 24 was antedated and that being so, the charge in respect of forgery of this letter also fails.\\nRead as a whole, this letter cannot be said to have been written with the intention of causing any injury to Amarnath or for the purpose of creating a defence in respect of the second charge.\\nThe letter read as a whole is an innocuous document and its dominant purpose and intent was to safeguard the interests of accused Patel and to protect him against any underhand or unfair act of his rival contractors.\\nWe cannot infer any intent to defraud or any intention to injure Amarnath, though in order to protect himself accused Patel made certain allegations against him.\\nWe therefore set aside the conviction of both the appellants under the third charge and acquit them.\\n1112 The result is that the consolidated appeal is allowed, the judgments of all the three courts below are set aside and the appellants are acquitted.\\nAppellants acquitted.\\nAgent for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 56 of 1951: Ganpat Rai.\\nAgent for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. S7 of 1951: Rajinder Narain.\\n</td>\n",

Sorabjee and Ranjit Kumar for the Appellants.\\nSharma and S.K. Jain for the Respondents.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by K.N. SAIKIA, J.\\nThis appeal by special leave is from the Judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated May 22, 1986 in Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 19 15 of 1986 quashig the bills issued by the appellants demanding minimum guaranteed charges from the respondents.\\nThe appellants Bihar State Electricity Board, Patna, hereinafter referred to .as 'the Board ', entered into an agreement with the respondent M/s.\\nGreen Rubber Industries, a partnership firm, hereinafter referred to as 'the firm ', on the latter 's application dated 26th July, 1978, for supplying the electricity of 60 KVA and on 13.4.\\n1981 gave electricity connection.\\nThe firm later applied that it 277 may be given 45 KVA instead of 60 KVA and it deposited the requisite sum of Rs.2700 and a fresh agreement was executed on May 2, 1981.\\nOn May 29, 1981 the firm was given fresh connection of 45KVA.\\nAccording to the firm it requested the Board on 19.6.\\n1981 to cut off the connection.\\nThe firm received the bills for minimum guaranteed charges for the months of June, July, August and September, 1981, though according to it no electricity was consumed by it during that period.\\nAccording to the Board on failure to pay the bills, the supply was disconnected on 28th September, 1981.\\nThe firm ultimately received a demand notice in October, 1981 for the minimum guaranteed charges from June, 1981 to August, 1981 amounting to Rs.22,95 1.50p.\\nThe firm having not paid the amount, the Board sent a requisition to the Certificate Officer who sent a notice to the firm on July 6, 1984.\\nRejecting the contention of the firm that it was not liable to pay, the Certificate Officer proceeded to pass an order for attachment of the firm 's property wherefore the firm filed a writ petition in the High Court of Judicature at Patna under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India for quashing the bills as well as the certificate proceedings.\\nBefore the High Court the Board contended that the firm was liable to pay the minimum guaranteed charges in terms of the agreement, the disconnection itself having been in terms thereof.\\nThe High Court took the view that the Board itself having effected the disconnection it was not entitled to any charges for the period after September, 1981 and it was not open to the Board to contend that under clause 9 of the agreement it was not open to either party to terminate the agreement of minimum guaranteed charges before the expiry of two years from the date of the agreement.\\nIn that view of the matter, the High Court quashed the bills as well as the certificate proceedings, but allowed the charges for the months of July, August and September, 1981 to be adjusted against the security money.\\nMr. Soli J. Sorabjee, the learned counsel for the appel lants, submits, inter alia, that the firm under the agree ment was liable to pay the minimum guaranteed charges irre spective of whether energy was consumed or not during the period of the agreement and that disconnection of the supply on failure of the firm to pay the energy bills would not affect the obligation; and that the High Court fell into error in holding that the Board itself having disconnected the energy supply line it could not claim minimum guaranteed charges thereafter.\\n278 None appears for the respondents despite notice in the regular as well as substituted manner of service.\\nThe question to be decided is whether despite the fact that the supply line was disconnected on September 28, 1981, the firm was still liable to pay the minimum guaranteed charges under the agreement.\\nThe answer depends on the agreement itself and the relevant provi sions of law.\\nClause 4 of the agreement says: \"The Consumer shall pay to the Board for the energy so supplied and registered or taken to have been supplied as aforesaid at the appropriate rates applicable to the Con sumer according to the tariffs framed by the Board and enforced from time to time, the present ly enforced tariffs being indicated in the Schedule to this agreement for easy reference.\\nSuch reference is subject to provisions of clause 15 appearing here inafter.\\nProvided that notwithstanding any thing said above but subject to the provisions of clause 13 hereinafter, the Consumer shall have to pay minimum charges as specified in the above said tariffs framed by the Board and enforced from time to time irrespective of whether energy to that extent has been con sumed or not.\\n(Such minimum charges are re ferred to as \"the minimum guaranteed charges\" in other places in this agreement.) That part of minimum guaranteed charges as is not billed monthly, the assess ment for the same will be generally made at the end of the year commencing from the 1st April, and ending with the 31st March of the following year which is the financial year of the Board.\\nIn case any agreement is entered into in between this period the above said part of the minimum guaranteed charges will be proportionate to the period for which the Consumer is connected.\\nAny bill on account of the minimum guaranteed consumption for the year or part thereof will be submitted by the end of June in each year.\\n\" From a perusal of the above clause it would be clear that the minimum guaranteed charges would be payable by the consumer irrespective of whether energy to that extent has been consumed or not.\\nIndeed, there would be no need for such a provision if the charges were to 279 depend only on the energy actually consumed.\\nClause 5 of the agreement is to the following effect: \"(a) Readings of meter shall be taken by the Board once in each month or such other inter vals or times as the Board shall deem expedi ent and the Board 's meter reader shall have access to the consumer 's premises at all reasonable time for the purpose of taking such readings.\\nThe Board shall within reasonable time deliver to the Consumer the bill for energy consumed during the month in accordance with the readings of the meters and subject to the minimum guaranteed charges.\\nThe consumer shall pay the amount under the bill so deliv ered within the due date specified therein as per terms of the tariffs framed by the Board and enforced from time to time.\\n(b) If the consumer fails to pay the amount of any bill due under this agreement within the due date specified in the bill referred to in clause 5(a) above, he shall pay a surcharge at the rate given in the tariffs framed by the Board and enforced from time to time.\\nIf the amount of such a bill remains unpaid after the due date specified in the bill, the Board may discontinue the supply after giving the Con sumer not less than 7 clear days ' notice.\\nThe service will be reconnected only on receipt of full payment for all obligations outstanding up to the date of reconnection and charges for the work of disconnection and reconnection of service. ' ' On a perusal of this clause there arises no doubt that if the amount of a bill submitted according to law remains unpaid after the due date specified in the bill, the Board may discontinue the supply after giving the consumer not less than 7 clear days ' notice.\\nThere is no dispute about notice in this case.\\nClauses 8 and 9 of the agreement deal with its duration and termination.\\nClause 8 of the agreement says: \"The agreement shall be ordinarily enforced for a period of not less than two years in the first instance (except in exceptional cases in which written consent of the Board will 280 be taken) from the date of commencement of supply, i.e. . . and thereafter shall continue from year to year until the agreement is determined as hereinafter provided.\\nNote: In case where the date of commence ment of supply is a date subsequent to that of the execution of this agreement, the Board is given power to fill in the date in the blank space.\\nprovided for the same in this clause with prior intimation to the Consumer.\\nThe Consumer can produce his copy of the agreement to have such date filled in by the Board.\\n\" Clause 9 Provides: \"(a) The consumers shall not be at liberty to determine this agreement before the expiration of two years from the date of commencement of supply of energy.\\nThe consumer may determine this agreement with effect from any date after the said period of giving to the Board not less than one calendar month 's previous notice in writing in that behalf and upon the expira tion of the period of such notice this agree ment shall cease and determine without preju dice to any right which may then have accrued to the Board hereunder, provided always that the consumer may at any time with the previous consent of the Board transfer or assign this agreement to any other person and upon sub scription of such transfer this agreement shall be binding on the transferee and the Board and take effect in all respects as if the transferee had originally been a party hereto in place of the consumer who shall henceforth be discharged from all liability under or in respect thereof.\\n(b) In case the consumer 's supply is discon nected by the Board in exercise of its powers under this agreement and/ or law and consumer does not apply for reconnection in accordance with law within the remainder period of the above given compulsorily availing of supply or that of notice whichever be longer, he will be deemed to have given a notice on the date of disconnection in terms of the aforesaid clause 9(a) for the determination of the agreement and on expiry of the above said remainder period of compulsorily availing of supply or notice whichever is longer, this agreement shall cease and determine in the same way as above.\\n\" 281 Thus it is seen that the consumer cannot determine the agreement before expiry of two years and there is nothing to show in this case that he did so after expiry thereof with previous notice.\\nIn fact the supply was disconnected by the Board for default.\\nWhat would be its effect on the agree ment? It is seen that in case of disconnection of the supply by the Board in exercise of its powers under the agreement it would be open for the consumer to apply for reconnection in accordance with the law within the remainder period of the above given compulsorily availing of supply or that of notice whichever is longer, he will be deemed to have given a notice on the date of disconnection in terms of aforesaid clause 9(a) for determination of the agreement and on expiry of the remainder period of compulsorily availing of supply or notice, whichever is longer, the agreement shall cease and determine.\\nIt is therefore clear that in the instant case the disconnection on the default of the cosumer having ' been effected on 28.9.1981 and the consumer having not applied for reconnection, it would be deemed to have given a notice on the date of disconnection in terms of clause 9(a) for the determination of the agreement and the agreement must be taken to have ceased and determined either at the end of the notice or at the end of the period of compulsori ly availing of supply i.e. two years of the agreement which ever was longer.\\nThe (fresh) agreement having been executed on May 4, 1981 it would expire on May 1, 1983.\\nThe discon nection having been effected on September 28, 1981 the period of deemed notice of seven days expired before the period of compulsorily availing of supply under the agree ment expired and hence the agreement must be deemed to have determined only on May 1, 1983.\\nDuring this period the consumer 's liability to pay the minimum guaranteed charges must be held to have continued.\\nMr. Soli J. Sorabjee submits, and we think rightly, that the High Court overlooked this important stipulation in the agreement which was binding on both the parties.\\nHowever, as the respondents are not before us, it is necessary to con sider the reasonability of the stipulation as to minimum guaranteed charges as argued by the learned counsel for the appellant Board.\\nWas there any power of the Board to enter into the agreement? If so, to what extent? The , hereinafter called 'the Act '.\\nprovides the law relating to the supply and use of electrical energy.\\nAs defined in section 2(11) of the Act \"State Electricity Board\" in relation to any State means the State Electricity Board, if any consituted for the 282 State under section 5 of the (54 of 1948) and includes any Board which functions in that State under sections 6 and 7 of the said Act.\\nThe appellant the Bihar State Electricity Board is a Board.\\nAs defined in section 2(h) \"licensee\" means any person licensed under to supply energy.\\nThe appellant Board is such a licensee under this provision.\\nAs defined in section 2(c) \"consumer\" means any person who is supplied with energy by a licensee or the Government or by any other person engaged in the business of supplying energy to the public under this Act or any other law for the time being in force, and in cludes any person whose premises are for the time being connected for the purpose of receiving energy with the works of a licensee, the Government or such other person, as the case may be.\\nThere is no doubt that the respondent was consumer.\\nThe , hereinafter called the 'Supply Act ', is an Act to provide for the realisation of the production and supply of electricity, and generally for taking measures conducive to electrical development and for all matters incidental thereto.\\nUnder sub section (1) of section 23 of the Act, a licen see shall not, in making any agreement for the supply of energy, show any undue preference to any person.\\nThus, this section envisages making of an agreement by the licensee with the consumer for the supply of energy.\\nThe instant agreement has, therefore, to be held as one envisaged by this provision.\\nWas the stipulation to pay minimum guaran teed charges, irrespective of whether energy was consumed or not, reasonable and valid? What is the consideration when less or no energy is consumed? Section 49 of the Supply Act makes provision for the sale of electricity by the Board to persons other than licensees.\\nUnder subsection (1), subject to the provisions of the Supply Act and the Regulations, if any, made in this behalf, the Board may supply electricity to any person not being a licensee upon such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit and may for the purpose of such supply frame uniform tariff.\\nUnder sub section (2) thereof nothing m sub sections (1) and (2) shall derogate from the power of the Board if it considers it necessary or expedient to fix different tariffs for the supply of electricity to any person not being a licensee, having regard to the geographi cal position of any area, the nature of the supply and purpose for which supply is required and any other relevant factors.\\nSub section (2) enumerates the factors to be consi derd by the Board in fixing the uniform tariffs.\\n283 It is seen that the rule of charging minimum guaranteed charges has been in vogue since long.\\nIn the London Electric Supply Corporation (Limited) vs Priddis, , the agreement between the appellant company and the consumer to supply electricity in clause 4 provided that the \"consumer shall have the option at or after the expiration of five years from the date of installation\" of purchasing the installation at a price.\\n7 said: \"The consumer shall until purchase as aforesaid pay quarterly to the supply company for the use of the installation 3/4d.\\nper Board of Trade Unit for every unit of electrical energy supplied to the said premises and the minimum payment in any year shall be Is.\\nfor each eight candle power lamp or its equivalent installed.\\n\" During the period from Mid summer to Michaelmas, 1900, the defendant did not use any electricity supplied by the plaintiff, and the question was whether under the agree ment the defendant was bound to pay the minimum payment provided for by cl. 7, even though in fact he had used none of the plaintiff 's electricity during the quarter.\\nThe Lord Chief Justice in giving judgment said that \"it was suffi ciently clear that the installation was put in on the terms that the customer should have the right to purchase the installation after five years, and during that five years the customer should be liable to pay minimum rent whether the current was de facto used or not.\\nThe minimum rent had no reference to the amount of current used, and it was, therefore, clear that the mere fact that the defendant had not taken any current or a small current did not affect the case.\\n\" Channel.\\nJ. concurring said that the \"meaning of the clause was that the minimum rent did not merely cover the actual use but the right to use the current.\\nThe customer had to pay for the right to use the current, although he did not in fact use it.\" In Saila Bala vs Darjeeling Municipality, AIR 1936 Calcutta 265, it was held by a learned single Judge that the minimum charge was not really a charge which had for its basis the consumption of electric energy.\\nIt was really based on the principle that every consumer 's installation involved the licensee in certain amount of capital expendi ture in plant and mains on which he was to have a reasonable return.\\nHe could get a return when the energy was actually consumed, in the shape of payments of energy consumed.\\nWhen no such energy was consumed by the consumer, or a very small amount was consumed in a longer period, the licensee was allowed to charge minimum charges by his licence, but those minimum charges were really interest on his capital outlay incurred for the particular consumer.\\nNatesan, J. in Natesa Chettiar vs The Madras State Electric ity 284 Board, , answering the question whether the provision for the minimum guarantee was just a stipulation by way of penalty or pre determined damages for breach on the part of the consumer or something else, held the view that the minimum fixed was only consideration for keeping the energy available to the consumer at his end; it was not a penalty for not consuming a stated quantity of energy but was a concession shown up to the amount fixed, energy at a specified rates could be consumed free, consump tion beyond only had to be paid for.\\nThe statutory basis for the terms in the agreement providing for minimum annual charge was found in section 22 of the Act and section 48 of the Supply Act.\\nSection 22 deals with obligation on licensee to supply energy.\\nThe proviso to the section says: \"No person shall be entitled to demand, or to continue to receive, from a licensee a supply of energy for any premises having a separate supply unless he has agreed with the licensee to pay to him such minimum annual sum as will give him a reasonable return on the capital expenditure, and will cover other standing charges incurred by him in order to meet the possible maximum demand for those premises, the sum payable to be determined in case of difference or dispute by arbitration.\" Section 48 of the Supply Act empowers the licensee to carry out arrangement under that Act.\\nIn Watkins Mayor &amp; Co. vs Jullundhur Electric Supply Co., AIR 1955 Punj. 133 (136), it was observed that the whole scheme of the Act seems to show that the provision made in any contract for a minimum charge was really to provide for a fair return on the outlay of the licensee, and it was for this reason that the law allowed the contract of this kind to be entered into.\\nClause XI A of the schedule to the Act, as it then stood, provided: \"A licensee may charge a consumer a minimum charge for energy of such amount and determine in such manner as may be specified by his licence, and such minimum charge shall be payable notwithstanding that no energy has been used by the consumer during the period for which such minimum charge is made.\" The Court accordingly held that there was nothing illegal in the insertion of the term for payment of a minimum charge in the agreement for 285 supply of energy and held that it had not been made out that it was an unreasonable levy.\\nA Division Bench of Allahabad High Court, in Hari Shan kar &amp; Ors.\\nvs U.P. State Electricity Board &amp; Anr., AIR 1974 Allahabad 70, held that when the electrical supply was being made on the footing that the consumer would pay the minimum guaranteed charges that charge was one of the terms and conditions for supply and fixation of that would be included in the fixation rates ;or the supply of electricity.\\nSimi larly in M/s. Bhagwan Industries Pvt.\\nLtd. Lucknow vs U.P. State Electricity Board, Lucknow, AIR 1979 Allahabad 249, a Division Bench held that an agreement for supply of elec tricity with the Board empowered it to revise the rates and that imposition of minimum consumption guarantee charge imposed by new tariff schedule under section 49 of the Supply Act was valid.\\nA Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Md. Abdul,Gaffar vs Andhra Pradesh Electricity Board, , also held that fixation of monthly minimum charges based on connected load and revisional rates for electrical consumption by non domestic consumers in accordance with the factors in section 49(2) was neither ultra vires nor arbitrary.\\nThe High Court in the case at hand relied on Rajeshwar Singh vs State of Bihar, AIR 1983 Patna 194, wherein it was held that when the disconnection of electric energy was effected by the Board then it could not ask for the minimum guaranteed charges.\\nThat decision must be confined to the facts of that case only.\\nIt is true that the agreement is in a standard form of contract.\\nThe standard clauses of this contract have been settled over the years and have been widely adopted because experience shows that they facilitate the supply of electric energy.\\nLord Diplock has observed: \"If fairness or reasona bleness were relevant to their enforceability the fact that they are widely used by parties whose bargaining power is fairly matched would raise a strong presumption that their terms are fair and reasonable.\" Schroder Music Co. Ltd. vs Macaulay, 16 (624).\\nIn such contracts a standard form enables the supplier to say: \"If you want these goods or services at all, these are the only terms on which they are available.\\nTake it or leave it.\\n\" It is a type of contract on which the conditions are fixed by one of the parties in advance and are open to acceptance by anyone.\\nThe contract, which frequently contains many conditions is presented for acceptance and is not open to discussion.\\nIt is settled law that a person who signs a 286 document which contains contractual terms is normally bound by them even though he has not read them, even though he is ignorant of the precise legal effect.\\nIn view of clause 4 having formed one of the stipulations in the contract along with others it cannot be said to be nudurn pactum and the maxim nudum pactum ex quo non oritur actio does not apply.\\nConsidered by the test of reasonableness it cannot be said to be unreasonable inasmuch as the supply of electricity to a consumer involves incurring of overhead installation expenses by the Board which do not vary with the quantity of electricity consumed and the installation has to be contin ued irrespective of whether the energy is consumed or not until the agreement comes to an end.\\nEvery contract is to be considered with reference to its object and the whole of its terms and accordingly the whole context must be considered in endeavouring to collect the intention of the parties, even though the immediate object of enquiry is the meaning of an isolated clause.\\nThis agreement with the stipulation of minimum guaranteed charges cannot be held to be ultra vires on the ground that it is incompatible with the statu tory duty.\\nDifferences between this contractual element and the statutory duty have to be observed.\\nA supply agreement to a consumer makes his relation with the Board mainly contractual, where the basis of supply is held to be statu tory rather than contractual.\\nIn cases where such agreements are made the terms are supposed to have been negotiated between the consumer and the Board, and unless specifically assigned, the agreement normally would have affected the consumer with whom it is made, as was held in Northern Ontario Power Co. Ltd. vs La Roche Mines Ltd., For the foregoing reasons we have no hesitation in holding that the agreement was reasonable and valid and it was not determined with the disconnection of supply to the respondent firm by the Board on 28th September, 1981 but only accordingly to the stipulations in clause 9(b) of the agreement as discussed above.\\nThe liability to pay the minimum guaranteed charges, therefore, continued till the determination of the contract.\\nThe Board was, therefore, entitled to submit the bills and make the demand on that account, and recover the same according to law.\\nIn the result, the impugned judgment is set aside and the appeal is allowed.\\nNo order as to costs.\\nY.

Chaudhuri, for the appellant.\\nB. V. Subramanyam, A. Subba Rao for A. V. Rangam, for respondent No. 1.\\nThat was a suit instituted by the Andhra Bank Ltd., the contesting respondent in this appeal.\\nThe suit was to recover the loans advanced to the Godavari Sugars Refiners Ltd., defendant No. 5 in the suit.\\nThe suit was decreed against all the defendants and that decree was affirmed by the High Court in appeal.\\nThe decree against the other defendants has become final.\\nThe only question that arises for decision in this appeal is whether the decree against the appellant is sustainable.\\nThe High Court rested the decree against the appellant only on the basis of exhibit A 6 a letter given by defendants 1, 4 and another to the Masulipatam branch of the plaintiff bank while, depositing Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8.\\nIn order to decide the correctness of the decree, it is necessary to refer to the material facts as found by the trial court and the High Court and which are no more in dispute.\\nDefendants I to 3 were the partners of a company known as Aid Co. Ltd. (defendant No. 6).\\nThat company was the managing agents of defendant No. 5, the Godavari Sugars Re finers Ltd. which will hereinafter be referred as Godavari Sugars.\\nThe first defendant was the Managing Director of the Aid Co. Ltd. On January 29, 1952, the first defendant made an appli 211 cation 'on behalf of Godavari Sugars to the Andra Bank Ltd. (which will hereinafter be referred to as the Bank) for a loan of three to four lakhs ofrupees under the keyloan and cash credit account and on the guarantee and co obligation of defendants 1 to 3 in their personal capacity also.\\nThe Managing Director and the General ,Manager recommended 'that applicalion to the Board of Directors upto a limit of Rs. 1,25,000.\\nBefore the sanction of the Board of Directors was obtained, the first defendant requested the Managing Director to sanction Rs. 50,000 tentatively as there was urgent need.\\nThe Managing Director sanctioned a sum of Rs. 50,000 in anticipation of the loan to be granted in pursuance of the application (EN, A3) made by the first defendant on January 29, 1952.\\nThe Managing Director authorised the agent of Bhimavaram branch to obtain the necessary documents signed by defendants 1 to 3 in their personal capacity as well as the first defendant as the Managing Director of the managing agents and on behalf of Godavari Sugars.\\nA pronote and the cash credit agreement relating to that loan were handed over to the agent of Bhimavaram branch on April 24, 1952 after the same were executed by defendants 1 to 3.\\nThereafter defendant I drew from the Bhimavaram branch Rs. 20,100 on April 25, 1952 and Rs. 9,000 on April 25, 1952.\\nBut he deposited a sum of Rs. 8,100 on April 25, 1952.\\nThus a sum of Rs. 21,000 was due to the bank under the loan in question on April 26, 1952.\\nOn that date the Board of Directors sanctioned the loan asked for under exhibit A 3 upto a limit of Rs. 1,25,000.\\nSometime thereafter the authorities of the Bank learnt that on a creditor 's winding up petition a provisional liquidator for the Godavari Sugars had been appointed by the High Court of Madras without objection from defendants 1 to 3 on April 18, 1952.\\nThat fact had not been brought to the notice of the Bank authorities by defendants 1 to 3 when the advances were made on the 25th and 26th of April 1952.\\nAfter coming to know of that fact, the Manager and the Managing Director of the Bank pressed defendants 1 to 3 to repay the amount drawn.\\nBut they were advised by Satyanarain Chowdary, the father in law of the first defendant (2nd defendant is the wife of the first defendant and the third defendant his mother in law) lo plead before the High Court that the Bank was a pledgee of the articles pledged for the keyloan and as such had a lien over the pledged goods in respect of the advances made.\\nThe Bank accordingly moved the High Court claiming a lien over the goods pledged but that claim was rejected by the High Court.\\nIn connection with the proceedings before the High Court the Bank incurred an expenditure of Rs. 1548 10 6.\\nThe claim against defendants 1 to 3 is based on the above facts.\\nThat claim has been decreed as mentioned earlier.\\nThe decree to that extent has become final.\\n212 Now coming to the claim against the appellant which is the only claim material for our present purpose, the facts disclosing the cause of action against him as set out in the plaint paragraph 9 are as follows : \"The defendants 1 and 4 requested the plaintiffbank to refrain from taking legal action at that time (after the bank 's claim was rejected by the High Court) and give them time.\\nFor all sums due till then and owing thereafter on any account by the defendants 1 and 4 either individually or jointly with others, two titles deeds (Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8) were deposited with the bank on 15 1 1953 at Masulipatam thereby creating Equitable Mortgage over the properties comprised therein and situated within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.\\nIn consideration of the above deposit,, the plaintiff bank refrained taking legal proceedings against the defendants 1 to 3 for the amount due and loss occurred to the plaintiff bank and an overdraft account was also sanctioned to the defendants 1 and 4.\\nThus the plaintiffbank has got security over the properties shown in the schedule covered by 'the two title, deeds deposited with the plaintiff bank on 15 1 1953 at Masulipatam for the suit debt, the particular of which are \"detailed hereunder\".\\nAccording to the plaint a mortgage by deposit of title deeds was created in pursuance of the contract set out above.\\nIn this appeal we are only concerned with the truth of that contract.\\nThe appellant denied the allegations contained in para 9 of the plaint.\\nAccording to him he had nothing to do with the suit transactions and that he never requested the Bank to refrain from taking legal action against defendants 1 to 3.\\nHe went further and averred in his written statement that he did not know anything about the suit transactions till the Bank refused to return to him Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8.\\nDealing with the deposit of Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8, he averred that those documents were deposited to create an Equitable Mortgage to secure an overdraft loan of Rs. 25,000 borrowed by him and that deposit has nothing to do with the suit transactions.\\nThe only question for decision is whether Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8 were deposited to secure the suit debts.\\nIn order to decide that question it is necessary to set out a few more facts.\\nDefendants 1 and the appellant are divided brothers.\\nThe first defendant was having his business in Madras.\\nThe appellant was having his business at Masulipatam.\\nMadras and Masulipatam are quite far off from one another.\\nBoth the appellant and defendant No. 1 appear to have had separate dealings with the 213 Bank even prior to the suit transactions.\\nWe have earlier referred to the loan application Exh.\\nA 3 made by the first defendant and the advances made.\\nFrom the pronote as well as the cash credit agreement referred to earlier, it appears that the loan was made on the security of the goods belonging to Godavari Sugars as well as on the personal security of defendants 1 to 3.\\nThat is also the basis on which the Board of Directors of the Bank sanctioned the loan see Exh.\\nNeither in Exh.\\nA 3 nor in Exh.\\nA 71 nor in any of the correspondence that passed between the Bank and defendant No. 1 there is any reference to the fact of appellant 's either standing as a surety for the loans advanced to the Godavari Sugars or his having given his property as security for that loan.\\nIt is also admitted that in the books of account kept by the Bank, the Equitable Mortgage created by the deposit of Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8 is not shown as a security for the advances mentioned in the plaint.\\nThere is neither documentary evidence nor reliable oral evidence to support the averments in para 9 of the plaint.\\nIn none of the correspondence that passed between the Bank and defendant No. 1 or that passed between the Bank ,and the appellant, there is any mention of the fact that at the instance of the appellant, the Bank had refrained from taking action against defendants 1 to 3.\\nNor is there any mention in them that because of the deposit of A 7 and A 8 along with the memorandum exhibit A 6 the Bank refrained from taking action against defendants 1 to 3.\\nNeither the Manager nor the Managing Director of the Bank who have been examined in support of the Bank 's claim spoke to the fact that they refrained from taking action against defendants 1 to 3 at the instance of the appellant or that they refrained from taking action against them because of the equitable mortgage referred to earlier.\\nThree witnesses namely P. Ws.\\n1 to 3 were examined in support of \"the plaintiff 's case.\\nNeither P.W. 1 nor P.W. 2 speaks to the circumstances under which exhibit A 6 came to be executed.\\nP.W. 3, the Managing Director of the Bank deposed in his Chief Examination as follows: \"D 4 applied for a loan as per exhibit A 67.\\nHe met me in that connection.\\nD 1 also met me in that connection.\\nD 4 represented that D 1 had commitments in regard to Godavari Sugars, that the and D 1 wanted monies and requested me to get exhibit A.67 be sanctioned representing that they would deposit title deeds that Would be additional security to safeguard the interest of the \"bank.\\nI told him that the loan of Rs. 50,000 could ' be\" 'Sanctioned if he agreed to pay outright the amount due from D 1.\\nD 4 represented that might prejudice our claim before the High Court as pledgee and that there would be 214 deposit of title deeds he.\\nmade a request ultimately to sanction at least Rs. 25,000.\\nD 1 also represented that title deeds would dedeposited and requested that the loan might be granted.\\nUnder exhibit A 67 loan of Rs. 25,000 was granted.\\nD 1 and D 2 gave title deeds as security for it.\\nWe did not take criminal action on the assurances given by them.\\nThis evidence is not consistent with the averments in plaint paragraph 9 to which reference has been made earlier.\\nIt makes out a new case.\\nFurther from that evidence, it is clear that the deposit of title deeds exhibit A 7 and exhibit A 8 were made to secure only the loan of Rs. 25,000 given to the appellant.\\nThe uncontroverted evidence in this case clearly establishes that the said loan was borrowed by the appellant for his own business.\\nFurther in his cross examination P.W. 3 deposed that \"the deposit of title deeds was made in terms of Board 's Resolution and as agreed to between the parties\".\\nThe Board 's Resolution granting loan to the Godavari Sugars on the application of defendant No. 1 does not either directly or indirectly refer to any mortgage by deposit of title deeds or even to any security of immovable property for the loan in question.\\nThe question of depositing title deeds was not before the Board when the loan was sanctioned to Godavari Sugars.\\nBut the loan granted to the appellant as we shall presently see was on the basis of a mortgage by deposit of title deeds.\\nBefore considering the scope and effect of exhibit A 6, it is necessary to refer to the circumstances leading to the execution of exhibit A 6.\\nOn October 15, 1952 under exhibit A 67, the appellant applied for a loan of Rs. 50,000.\\nColumn four in that application refers to the purpose for which the loan was asked.\\nThe answer given was \"For business\".\\nUnder column \"Other additional guarantee or security\", answer given was \"On the security of title deed i.e. sites possessed by me at Vijayawada Krishna District which costs about one Lakh at present Market value\" In the covering letter the appellant stated .\\n\"sir, As desired above, I request for sanction of loan of Rs. 50,000 on secured overdrafts Being bound by your previous Bank Rules and also bound by any changes in them, we will clear the loan according to your current Bank rate.\\nOtherwise if we fail to clear the loan in time, we will not only pay, as and when necessary, the penal interest, but also agree, to be bound by all the actions taken against us.\\n215 Further changes in the particulars of the property given in the list have been affected.\\nWe have not made any sort of alienations whatsoever on this property.\\nUntil your loan is cleared, we are not going to make any sort of alienations.\\nIf becomes necessary to do so, we will do the same after obtaining your consent, Be pleased to consider Sd/ Veeramachaneni Gangadhara Rao (In Telugu)\".\\nThis application was placed before the Board of Directors on January 11, 1953.\\nThe relevant agenda for the Board 's con sideration reads as follows: \"Loans.and Overdrafts: 3.To consider the application of Mr. Veerama chaneniGangadhararao.\\nMasulipatam, for a secured overdraft limit of Rs. 50,000 for one year at 7% p.a. on the co obligation of Messrs. Kolli Surya Prakasa Rao and Adusumilli; Venkata Krishna Rao and on the mortgage by deposit of title deeds relating to the applicant 's sites of the extent of about 2,662 sq.\\nat Vijayawada of the approximate value of about Rs. One Lakh.\\nResolution: Sanctioned Rs. 25,000.\\n\" From the above facts it is clear that the loan of Rs. 25,000 granted to the appellant was a secured loan secured by a mortgage by deposit of title deeds in respect of his sites at Vijaywada.\\nIt may be noted that neither the appellant nor his co obligants are shown to have had anything to do with Godavari Sugars.\\nIt appears from the records of the Bank that some of documents deposited were not originals.\\nTherefore the Bank found it necessary to have legal advice in the matter.\\nAccording to the appellant one of the items covered by Exh.\\nA 7 was of the joint ownership of himself and his brother defendant No. 1, hence the officers of the Bank wanted defendant No. 1 also to join in making the deposit of title deeds; but defendant No. 1 was a that time in Madras; therefore a printed form was given to for getting the signatures of defendant No. 1; the place at defendant No. 1 was to sign in that form was marked in pencil that form was sent to Madras with his clerk accompanied by a bank official; defendant No. 1 's signatures were obtained; there after the same was signed by him in the presence of the Bank 's agent at Masulipatam and given to the Bank 's agent without scoring out any of the words in the printed form.\\nThe appellant does not appear to be familiar with English language.\\nAs could 216 be seen in exhibit A 67.\\nhe has signed that same id Telugu.\\nexhibit A 6, as mentioned earlier, is in a printed form, That was a ready made form which could, be used for various purposes.\\nIt was an all comprehensive form relating to the deposit of title deeds.\\nIt is clear from the terms in that form that the parties were required to strike out the unnecessary terms and conditions in that form.\\nAdmittedly no term in Exh.\\nA 7 was struck out.\\nAccording to P.W. 1, the agent of the Bank, the appellant brought that form at about 5 p.m. just when the Bank was about to close.\\nTherefore he did not strike out the unnecessary words in that document.\\nIn this background, we have to see whether Exh.\\nA 6 ,is only a memorandum in support of the deposit of Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8 to secure the loan advanced to the appellant under Exh.\\nA 67 or whether the deposit of title deeds in question were intended to secure that loan as well as all amounts due from defendant No. 1 to the Bank.\\nThe loan advanced to the appellant under exhibit A 67 has been admittedly discharged and the pronote executed by him in that connection had been returned to him.\\nThe loans granted to Godavari Sugars were disbursed at the Bhimavaram Branch of the Bank as could be gathered from plaint paragraph 5.\\nThe loan sanctioned to the appellant was disbursed at the Masulipatam branch.\\nA 6, A 7 and A 8 were produced in the Masulipatam Branch.\\nThe Masulipatam Branch does not appear to have had anything to do with the loans advanced to Godavari Sugars.\\nWe have earlier mentioned that in the accounts relating to the loan given to Godavari Sugars, ,ther e is no mention as to the deposit of title deeds.\\nAll the correspondence relating to the loans granted to Godavari Sugars proceed on the basis that they were granted on, the perso nal responsibility of the defendants 1 to 3 and on the pledge of the goods belonging to that company see exhibit\\nA 3, loan application exhibit A 2, agreement for cash credit on the security of pledged goods, exhibit A 13, letter written, to the agent, Bhimavaram Branch by the General Manager of the Bank on April 15, 1952, Exh.\\nA 14 letter, written by the General Manager to the Agent, Bhimavaram Branch on April 16, , letter written by the first defendant to the Bank on, October 29, 1952, But the correspondence that passed between the appellant and the Bank shows that the deposit of title.\\n, deeds.\\nwas made to secure the loan advance to him under exhibit A 67.\\nUnder exhibit A,20 the appellant wrote, to the, Bank on October, 15, 1952 as follows: \"Dear Sir, I have, two sites at Bezwada worth about; Rs. 1,00,000 and 1.\\npropose to deposit Tide Deeds of the same and require a secured over draft of Rs. 50,000 against the same.\\nMy property statement is with you.\\nI shall therefore be glad if you sanction the same at an early date. . . \" 217 To the same effect is the loan application made ,by him on the same date.\\nBut an ' overdraft of Rs. 25,000 only was sanctioned.\\nOn February 6, 1954, the appellant wrote to the Bank that he had cleared the overdraft account of Rs. 25,000 but he wanted a renewal of over draft arrangement (exhibit A 22).\\nHe sent a reminder in that connection on April 1, 1954 (exhibit A 23).\\nAs the Bank delayed in making available the over draft facility asked for, he wrote to the Bank on Septr. 20, 1954 under exhibit A 25 as follows \"Masulipatam Dated 20 9 54.\\nV.

I shall be obliged for immediately allowing 'me to draw the amount.\\nThanking you.\\nYours faithfully, Sd/ Illegible.\\n\" From this letter it is clear that the Bank was putting pressure on the appellant to persuade his brother defendant No. 1 to amicably settle the suit loans; That is also the ' evidence of the appellant.\\nThe allegation in this letter that 'the Managing 218 Director was requesting the appellant: to mediate for the amicablesettlement of the affairs of defendant 1 with the Bank regarding suit loans does not appear to, have been repudiated in any of ' the letter,% written by the Managing Director to the appellant.\\nThough the Board of Directors of the Bank sanctioned on February 14, 1954, the renewal of.\\nthe over draft facility asked ' for by the appellant the appellant was not permitted to utilise that facility.\\nThe appellant 's case is that the Managing Director of the Bank was using that opportunity to put pressure on him to see that defendant 1 discharged the suit loans.\\nBeing fed ' up with the delaying tactics of the Bank, the appellant withdrew his loan application and asked the Bank to return his title deeds.\\nIt is only at that stage that the Bank took up the position that the title deeds deposited were also intended to secure the amounts due from defendant 1 to the Bank.\\nThe appellant repudiated ' that claim.\\nThen the Bank issued the lawyers ' notice exhibit A 18 to all the defendants on April 5, 1954.\\nTherein it was stated ' for the first time that the Bank refrained from proceeding against defendants 1 to 3 in respect of the suit transactions at the instance of Satyanarayan Chowdary and the appellant and those two persons had agreed to indemnify the Bank any loss that may be, caused due to those transactions.\\nFurther suggestion in that notice is that in pursuance of that agreement exhibit A 7 and A 8 were deposited under exhibit A 6.\\nThese allegations were repudiated ' by the appellant in his registered reply notice exhibit A 19 date&amp; April 21, 1954.\\nFrom the above discussion it is clear that apart from exhibit A 6, there is absolutely no evidence to show that the deposit of Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8 was intended to secure not merely the loan advanced ' to the appellant under exhibit A 67 but also to secure the suit loans.\\nor other debts due from defendant to the Bank.\\nThe oral evidence of P.W. 3, the Managing Director is of no assistance as seen earlier.\\nIt does not connect the deposit of title deeds, Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8 with any of the debts due from defendant 1.\\nThis leaves us with exhibit A 6, the printed form containing the terms and conditions under which Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8 were deposited.\\nThe material portion of that document reads as follows: \"To The Agent, The Andhra Bank Ltd., Masulipatam.\\nDear Sir, I/We write to put on record that as already agreed, upon I/We have on 15 1 53 delivered by way of deposit 219 at Masulipatam the.\\nfollowing documents of title to immovable property with intent to secure the repayment to, the Bank of moneys that are now due or shall from time to time or at any time be due from me/ us either solely or jointly with any other person or persons to the Bank whether on balance of account or by discount or otherwise in respect of Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes, Cheques and other negotiable instruments or in any manner whatsoever and including interest.\\ncommission and other banking charges and any law costs incurred in connection thereto.\\nLIST OF DOCUMENTS section Nature of Title Description Estimated No. deed and date property and value exact situation 1.\\nSale Deed D/ 4 2 49.\\nTwo plots of house site bearing assessment No. 7 501 in ward No. 22 and bearing No. 21612 N.

W. 1) that he did not strike out the unnecessary words in exhibit A 6 as it was presented before him late in the evening.\\nThe language of exhibit A 6 is undoubtedly wide and if it governs the agreement between the parties then there can be no doubt that the suit debts are also secured by the deposit of title deeds A 7 and A 8.\\nIn the first place exhibit A 6, for the reasons already mentioned must be held to be an incomplete document.\\nTherefore it can not be considered as a contract between the parties.\\nAccording to the plaintiff, the appellant agreed to secure the debt due from the first defendant to the Bank in consideration of the Bank not proceeding against defendants 1 to 3.\\nNo such term is found in Exh.\\nFrom the recitals of Exh.\\nA 6, it is seen that that memorandum in question was intended to \"put on record\" the terms already agreed upon.\\nThat being the case, the document cannot be considered as a contract entered into between the parties.\\nIf the parties intended that it should embody the contract between them, it would have been necessary to register the same under section 17 of the .\\nAs observed by this Court in Rachpal Maharaj vs Bhagwandas Daruka and ors.(1) that \"when a debtor deposits with the creditor title deeds of his property with intent to create a security, the law implies a contract between the parties to create a mortgage and no registered instrument is required under section 59 as in other forms of mortgage.\\nBut if the parties choose to reduce the contract to writing, the implication is excluded by their express bargain, and the document will be the sole evidence of its terms.\\nIn such a case the deposit and the document both form integral parts of the transaction and are essential ingredients in the creation of the mortgage.\\nAs the deposit alone is not intended to create the charge and the document, which constitutes the bargain regarding the security, is also necessary and operates to create the charge in conjunction with the deposit, it requires registration under section 17 of the Indian , I 1908, as a non testamentary instrument, creating an interest in immovable property, where the value of such property is one hundred rupees and upwards.\\n\" Therefore the crucial question is : Did the parties intend to reduce their bargain regarding the deposit of the title deeds to the form of a document? If so, the document requires registration.\\nIf on (1) ; 221 the other hand.\\nits proper construction and the surrounding circumstances lead to the conclusion that the parties did not intend to do so, then, there being no express bargain, the contract to create the mortgage arises by implication of the law from the deposit itself with the requisite intention.\\nand the document being merely evidential does not require registration.\\nThe law relating to the nature of a memorandum filed along with the deposit of title deeds or one filed thereafter has come up for consideration by courts in this country as well as in England.\\nThe decisions on the subject are numerous.\\nWe have already referred to the decision of this Court in Rachpal Maharaj 's case (1).\\nWe shall now refer to two of the decisions , of the Judicial Committee.\\nIn Pranjivandas Mehta vs Chan Ma Phee(2) dealing with the law on the subject Lord Shaw of Dunfermline observed \"The law upon this subject is beyond an doubt (1)Where titles of property are handed over, with nothing said except that they are to be security, the law supposes that the scope of the security is the scope of the title.\\n(2) Where however, titles ' are handed over accompanied by a bargain, that bargain must rule.\\n(3) Lastly, when the bargain is a written bargain, it, and it alone, must determine what is the scope and the extent of the security.\\nIn the words of Lord Cairns in the leading case of: Shaw vs Foster (3), \"Although it is a wellestablished rule of equity that a deposit of a document of title, without more, without writing, or without word of mouth will create in equity a charge upon the property referred to, I apprehend that that general rule will not apply where you have a deposit accompanied by an actual written charge.\\nIn that case you must refer to the terms of the written document, and any implication that might be raised, supposing there were no document, is put out of the case and reduced to silence by the document by which alone you must be governed.\" In Subrmonian and anr.\\nvs Lutchman and ors.(4) Lord Carson speaking for the Judicial Committee stated the law thus: \"The law upon the subject admits of no doubt.\\nIn the case of Kedarnath Dutt vs Shamloll Khettry (5) Couch C. J. said: \"The rule with regard to writings (1) [1950] S.C.R.548.\\n(2) L.R.43 I.A.123.\\n(3) [1872] L.R. 5 H.L.321, 341.\\n(4) 51),I.A.77.\\n(5) It Ben.\\nL.R.(O.C.J.)405.\\n222 is that oral proof cannot.\\nbe substitute for, the written evidence ;of any contract which the parties have put into writing, And.\\nthe reason is that the writing is tacitly considered by the parties themselves as the only repository and the appropriate evidence of,, their agreement.\\nIf this memorandum was of such a nature that it could be treated as the contract for the mortgage and what the parties considered to be the only repository and ,appropriate evidence of their agreement it would he the instrument by which the equitable mortgage was created, and would come within section 17 of the :\" Exhibit A 6 is not registered.\\nIf that document is considered as a contract of mortgage between the Bank and the depositors, the same having not been registered, it is inadmissible in evidence.\\nIf on the other band that document is considered as a mere memorandum evidencing the deposit of tide deeds in pursuance of an earlier contract then the correctness of the recitals therein can be gone into without being inhibited by sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act.\\nWhichever view is taken the plaintiffs case must fail.\\nOn an overall consideration of the evidence and the probabilities of the case, we are satisfied that Exhs.\\nA 7 and A 8 were not deposited with the Bank to secure the debts due from defendant No. I to the Bank In the result this appeal is allowed, the decree and judgment against the appellant is set aside and the suit against him is .dismissed with costs throughout.\\nG.C Appeal allowed.\\n</td>\n",

Goswami, the learned counsel for the appellants contended that by operation of Section 2 A, the appellants are deemed tenants.\\nOnce the appellants are deemed tenants, the Revenue Court has to decide that issue.\\nThe second appeal is a continuation on the suit and therefore, the High Court is not right in rejecting the claims of the appellants.\\nIt is not necessary to express any opinion on the correctness of the judgment of the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court.\\nSuffice it to say that the appellants had not specifically pleaded that the appellants are deemed tenants by operation of Section 2 A of the Act.\\nWhat was pleaded in the written statement was that initially the appellants ' predecessor was continuing as cultivating tenant.\\nBut by virtue of the mortgage, their tenancy right merged in the right as usufructuary mortgagee.\\nOn redemption pre existing tenancy rights get revived.\\nBut that plea was not pursued.\\nA new plea based on Section 2 A was sought to be raised for the first time in the High Court.\\nThe High Court rightly did not permit the appellants to raise the plea of a deemed tenancy as the said claim needs investigation based on factual foundation which was lacking.\\nOnce the right of tenancy is not permitted to be raised, the question of construction of Section 85 A whether the Civil Court had jurisdiction or not is an academic issue.\\nAccordingly, we are not going into that question.\\nThe learned counsel for the appellants also contended that the appellants are entitled to the improvements.\\nThe High Court did not go into that question as the same was not canvassed and the decree of the appellate court is quite right.\\nWe cannot go into that question which is accordingly rejected.\\nThe appeal, is accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances without costs.\\nT.N.A.
